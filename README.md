Demo for [NJSDoc with JSDT](https://bitbucket.org/nexj/webtools.jsdt.core).

# Setup

1. Add this project to your workspace, for example by cloning with MercurialEclipse. The project must have the name `njsdoc-demo`.
2. Install NJSDoc+JSDT (both the JSDT fork and the NJSDoc plugin) from this update site `https://bitbucket.org/nexj/updatesite/raw/default`

See `.settings/.njsdoc` for recipe configuration. Note: After making changes to recipe configurations including 
index.html restarting Eclipse is needed (see [this bug](https://bitbucket.org/nexj/webtools.jsdt.core/issue/8/implement-automatic-change-detections-in)).
